# GuiPittix

## What?
An absolute minimum, simple to use TFT GUI for Arduino.

## Why
The most GUI ( graphical user interface ) libraries are quite complicated to use.
The need huge initalization scripts and the code itself is often difficult to unterstand.
This library simplifies the usage of GUI-elements on a TFT in an Arduino way: 
The code is reduced to the absolute minimum and the API is made as simple as possible.

To get an impression take a look at the [Led example](https://github.com/ChrisMicro/GuiPittix/blob/master/examples/Led/Led.ino)

## Installation

Libraries used:
1. Import the Adadruit library in the menue
Sketch=>Include Libraries=>Manage Libraries =>  Adafruit ILI9341   
2. Import the Adadruit GFX-Library
Sketch=>Include Libraries=>Manage Libraries =>  Adafruit GFX Library  

If you want to use an STM32 MCU you have to install the [STM32GENERIC framework](https://github.com/ChrisMicro/STM32GENERIC).
